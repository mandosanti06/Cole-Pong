# Cole-Pong

Cole-Pong is a simple Pong-like game built using Python and Pygame. The game features a splash screen, gameplay, and an end screen, where players can retry or return to the home screen. The game also keeps track of the high score across rounds.

## Features

- **Splash Screen**: The game starts with a splash screen that displays the game title and a "Start" button. The player can either click the button or press the spacebar to start the game.
- **Gameplay**: Control the paddle using the left and right arrow keys. The objective is to bounce the ball off the paddle to keep it from falling below the screen. Every time the ball hits the paddle, the score increases, and the speed of the ball increases slightly.
- **End Screen**: When the ball is missed, the game ends, and an end screen is shown with options to retry or return to the home screen.
- **High Score**: The game keeps track of the highest score achieved in a session.
- **Music**: Background music plays during the game, featuring "Banda Colegial."

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the paddle left and right.
- **Spacebar**: Start the game and launch the ball.
- **Mouse Click**: Use the buttons on the splash and end screens.

## How to Play

1. Run the game using Python and Pygame installed.
2. Start the game from the splash screen by pressing the spacebar or clicking the "Start" button.
3. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
4. Try to keep the ball bouncing by hitting it with the paddle.
